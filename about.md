The RISBIC project (Removing the Information Security Barrier in to the Cloud) is a collaborative project between Arjuna Technologies, Red Hat and Newcastle University funded by the UK Government's Technology Strategy Board (TSB).

In a nutshell, the project seeks to provide an on-ramp for bodies to open up their data in a controlled manner where SLAs are respected and can be changed at runtime as the data's requirements evolve.
